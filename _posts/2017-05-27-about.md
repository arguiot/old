# Who am I?
I guess that if you managed to get into this page you know a little bit about me, but I'll try my best to describe myself.

I am <span var="age"></span> years old (I know it's pretty precise). Ok, I know what you're going to say that I'm super young and that I learned code just for fun and also that I can't describe myself as developer. You're 50% right, I agree I'm young, but on the internet, age doesn't count and we don't really care how old you are if you do what you can do to develop this industry.

So, don't judge me on my age, but instead, judge me on competences. If I had to describe myself in one word, I'll probably say "geek", because geeks are often associated with an abnormal appreciation for mathematics, programming, etc... (thank you Wikipedia). And, this definition is pretty close of what I am.

I believe that these kind of people are the kind of people who are the most able to push forward the limit of humanity in every subject, and this, for one reason: their passion. And I have to say that when I very like something, I will hardly give up.

## How can I help?
Need a website or need advice for creating a website, or anything about technology / mathematic, you can contact me or tweet me. I'll be honoured to answer you.
